# Smart Doorbell – Group 15
## Session Handoff Document
**Date:** 2026-06-10
**Purpose:** Full context for continuing in a new session

---

## Project Overview

An IoT smart doorbell built on the ESP32-CAM (AI Thinker). When a visitor presses a button:
1. ESP32-CAM captures a photo
2. Sends a Telegram notification with the photo and two reply buttons (✅ On my way / 🏠 Not home)
3. Visit is saved to the cloud backend database
4. Dashboard updates live via WebSocket

**Stack:** Arduino C++ (firmware) · Python FastAPI on **Railway** + **Supabase PostgreSQL** (backend) · Vanilla JS (dashboard) · Telegram Bot API

## ☁️ Cloud Architecture (NEW — replaced SQLite + ngrok)

```
ESP32 ──→ Railway (FastAPI) ──→ Supabase (Postgres, Tokyo region)
                │
                ├──→ Telegram (notifications + reply webhook)
                └──→ Dashboard (WebSocket live updates)
```

| Piece | Where | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Backend API | https://smart-doorbell-production.up.railway.app | ✅ live |
| **Live dashboard** | https://smart-doorbell-production.up.railway.app (root URL) | ✅ served by FastAPI, works from any device |
| Database | Supabase project "Smart-Doorbell" (`aws-1-ap-northeast-1`, transaction pooler port 6543) | ✅ live, RLS enabled |
| Telegram webhook | registered to `<railway-url>/telegram/webhook` | ✅ verified round-trip |
| ngrok | — | 🗑️ no longer needed, ever |

**Verified end-to-end on 2026-06-10:** visit posted from cloud → Telegram notification received → "✅ On my way" tapped → response stored in Supabase (visit id 5) → readable via public API.

**Railway setup notes:**
- Deploys automatically on every push to `main` (GitHub repo `yussefz99/Smart-Doorbell`)
- Service **Root Directory = `/backend`** (required — repo root has no Python app)
- Variables set in Railway: `BOT_TOKEN`, `CHAT_ID`, `DATABASE_URL`
- Settings changes are **staged** — must click the purple "Apply changes/Deploy" banner
- `psycopg2-binary` must be **≥2.9.10** (2.9.9 has no Python 3.13 wheels → `libpq.so.5` ImportError)

---

## 🔑 Credentials — where they live (never in git)

| Secret | Local | Cloud |
|--------|-------|-------|
| `BOT_TOKEN`, `CHAT_ID` | `backend/.env` | Railway → Variables |
| `DATABASE_URL` (Supabase pooler string) | `backend/.env` | Railway → Variables |
| WiFi + bot creds for firmware | `ESP32/doorbell_step5_complete_v1/secrets.h` (gitignored; template: `secrets.h.example`) | — |

⚠️ **Deferred task:** the old bot token leaked in git history (commit `e212e4f`). User chose to keep it for now — **revoke via @BotFather later**, then update: `backend/.env`, Railway `BOT_TOKEN` variable, `secrets.h`, and re-check webhook.

## File Locations

| File | Path |

## Hardware State

### Working (tested)
- Camera (QVGA JPEG ~6 KB), WiFi + Telegram text, photo upload to Telegram, flash LED (GPIO 4)

### ⏳ THE ONE BLOCKER: button not yet connected
- Button must connect **GPIO 13 (IO13) + GND**
- CS-CAM carrier exposes only **bare solder pads** (module pins soldered face-down; female jumpers can't grip, holes are filled) → **soldering required**
- User has soldering iron access at university lab
- **Plan:** solder two wires onto the IO13 and GND pads → other ends to **two diagonal legs** of the 6×6 mm tactile button (same-side legs are internally connected!)
- Quick pre-check at lab: with sketch running, briefly short IO13 pad to GND pad with a wire — photo should hit Telegram

### Missing hardware (requested via WhatsApp group, Hebrew message sent)
1. **PIR motion sensor** — team OK to drop the motion feature if hard to get
2. **MAX98357A I²S amp + speaker** — voice/sound to visitor
3. **0.96″ OLED 128×64 SSD1306, I²C** — chosen from catalog (2 pins only; ESP32-CAM is pin-starved) — to display homeowner's reply to the visitor

---

## Step 5 Sketch — Current State (FULLY TESTED on hardware 2026-06-10)

- Credentials come from `secrets.h` (`#include`) — already filled locally, upload-ready
- `BACKEND_URL = "https://smart-doorbell-production.up.railway.app"` — set
- **`TRIGGER_ON_BOOT true`** — demo mode: pressing the carrier's RESET button fires one doorbell event (works around the unwired GPIO 13 button). Set to `false` after soldering the real button.
- **Single notification path:** ESP32 uploads the photo (multipart) to `/api/visits`; the BACKEND sends the one Telegram message with photo + working reply buttons. Direct ESP32→Telegram send remains only as fallback when `BACKEND_URL` is empty.
- Camera output flipped 180° in software (`set_vflip` + `set_hmirror`) — module sits rotated in the CS-CAM carrier
- `BUTTON_PIN 13`, debounce + 3 s min gap, GPIO 0 conflict fixed (GPIO 0 = camera XCLK, unusable)
- Arduino IDE: board **AI Thinker ESP32-CAM**, port **COM3**, Serial 115200

**Verified on real hardware:** RESET press → photo captured → uploaded to Railway (201) → one Telegram photo message → reply tapped → caption edited + response in Supabase + live dashboard update.

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP (at the lab)

1. Solder button to IO13 + GND (diagonal legs)
2. Set `TRIGGER_ON_BOOT` to `false`, re-upload
3. Press the real button → same verified flow

## How to Run / Deploy

```bash
# Local backend (uses cloud Supabase DB via .env)
cd backend
uvicorn server:app --reload --port 8001

# Deploy = just push to main (Railway auto-deploys)
git push origin main
```

No ngrok. Webhook is permanently registered to Railway.

## Known Issues

| # | Issue | Status |
|---|-------|--------|
| 1 | Old bot token in git history | ✅ **Revoked 2026-06-10** — history copy is dead. New token in `.env`, Railway, `secrets.h`. ESP32 flash still has old token (harmless — only the no-backend fallback path uses it); refresh on next upload |
| 2 | Button not wired | ⏳ solder at lab — IO13 + GND pads |
| 3 | Telegram "remove buttons after reply" uses `editMessageCaption` — fails silently on **text-only** messages (no photo). Photo messages fine. | Low priority |
| 4 | Settings page UI only — not wired to backend | Deferred to V2 |
| 5 | Railway trial credit ($5 / 30 days) — check usage before demo day | Watch |
| 6 | Photos stored on Railway's ephemeral disk | ✅ **Fixed 2026-06-10** — photos upload to Supabase Storage (public `photos` bucket, `apikey` header with `sb_secret_` key); visit stores permanent public URL; verified live |
| 7 | ESP32 never posts `/api/device/heartbeat` — Diagnostics page shows stale data | ✅ **Fixed 2026-06-10** — sketch sends heartbeat every 60 s with real RSSI; backend computes `online` (<150 s); dashboard shows 🟢 Online / 🔴 Offline, auto-refreshes; verified on hardware |

**Supabase Storage env vars** (in `backend/.env` + Railway): `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`.

## What Comes After Step 5

1. **Face recognition (V3) — BUILT but PARKED (off by default), team decision pending:**
   - **Status:** full pipeline implemented and tested in the cloud: photo → embedding (InsightFace ONNX) → pgvector nearest-visitor match → visit linked → Telegram says "Rami is at the door!" / "Visitor #N" / "New visitor"; visitors API (list/rename/delete). Dashboard Visitors page NOT built yet.
   - **Why parked:** (a) the resident model holds ~600 MB 24/7 → burns the Railway trial credit ~6× faster, risking the whole backend dying before demo day; (b) the small model (`buffalo_s`) failed to match the user's two QVGA test photos (similarity −0.01 vs 0.54 with `buffalo_l`) — accuracy needs the big model and/or the new VGA photos; (c) `buffalo_l` may OOM the container → crash-loop risk.
   - **To enable (e.g. demo day):** Railway → Variables → `RECOGNITION_ENABLED=1` (optionally `FACE_MODEL=buffalo_l`, watch memory) → redeploy. That's all.
   - **To remove permanently (if team decides):** delete `backend/recognition.py` + `backend/railpack.json`; remove the 5 face deps from `requirements.txt`; in `server.py` remove `RECOGNITION_ENABLED`, the lifespan warmup block, the recognition block in `create_visit`, the `/api/recognition/health` endpoint, the Visitors API section, and `visitor_*` fields in `row_to_visit`/`get_visits` JOIN; in `telegram_bot.py` restore the simple caption headline; in Supabase run: `ALTER TABLE visits DROP COLUMN visitor_id; DROP TABLE visitor_embeddings; DROP TABLE visitors;` (optionally `DROP EXTENSION vector;`). Camera VGA bump can stay (better photos regardless).
   - Accuracy note for the future: real mounted-at-door VGA photos + `buffalo_l` + threshold ~0.4, multiple embeddings per visitor (already implemented, max 5).
2. **OLED screen feature** (when HW arrives): new endpoint `GET /api/visits/{id}/response` + ESP32 polls it and shows the reply to the visitor
3. **Audio** (when HW arrives): buzzer tones vs voice — open team decision
4. **Settings API** — `GET/POST /api/settings`, wire to dashboard
